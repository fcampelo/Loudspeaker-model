## Loudspeaker design model

(**Warning: the current definition of the loudspeaker has some conflicts between the documentation and the actual model (e.g., different material properties used for the permanent magnet, leading to different properties). Please use this only as a general example, not as an actual loudspeaker model.**)


This model is inspired on the loudspeaker design example originally proposed by [Infolytica Corporation](http://www.infolytica.com/en/applications/ex0086/). 
The objective of this problem is the minimization of the total volume of material used, subject to the generation of a given 
magnetic flux density in the air gap defined by variable **x9**. 

This problem can also be very easily turned into a multiobjective optimization example, by considering the minimization of 
volume and the maximization of the magnetic flux density.
